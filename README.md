# Spartan-3AN Development Board

## Description

A custom development board built over a Spartan-3AN FPGA. <br>
Built over 4 layers, it gives controlability over the Spartan-3AN Mode Pins through switches. This way it can be programmed both via JTAG and USB.
For the different combinations of Mode switches refer to Spartan-3AN documentation. For Slave Mode (where PIC32M250F128D acts as master), all three mode pins have to be HIGH.<br>
Note that the PIC32M250F128D requires adequate programming to function as the Master for the FPGA. 

## Features
* Spartan 3AN XC3S50AN-TQG144 FPGA
* PIC32MX250F128D-IPT for connecting with USB
* JTAG Header Pins
* M0-2 switches in order to switch from JTAG to Slave Mode to other modes and viceversa
* 4 Custom Switches
* 4 Pushbuttons
* 4 LED Lights
* VGA Connections
* All other pins connected with headers or sockets
